#### 1. 2M EVs Sold | 57M Total Vehicles

##### Shows India's EV market is scaling, but EVs are still <4% of all vehicle sales.

#### 2. 1M EVs Sold in FY2024 Alone

##### Half of all EVs sold between 2022–24 occurred in just one year.

##### ✅ Action: Indian EV adoption is accelerating fast — it’s the right time to enter


#### 3. Top Makers (2W): Ola Electric, TVS, Ather

##### These brands dominate 2-wheeler EVs.

##### ✅ Action: Benchmark their design, pricing, and marketing for AtliQ’s 2W entry.


#### 4. Bottom Makers (2W): Volvo, Kia, Mercedes

##### Luxury and global brands trail in volume.

##### ✅ Action: High price points are a barrier — AtliQ should consider value-driven EVs.

#### 6. Top States by Penetration: Goa (9.84), Karnataka (7.84)

##### Goa is India’s highest EV adopter.

##### ✅ Action: Focus on Goa, Karnataka, Delhi for early traction.


#### 7. Karnataka vs Delhi (2024)

##### Karnataka has higher EV sales (161K vs 47K) and penetration (10.18% vs 7.71%).

##### ✅ Action: Karnataka is a stronger beachhead for initial rollout.


#### 8. No State Had Negative EV Growth
